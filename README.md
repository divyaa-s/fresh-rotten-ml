# fresh-rotten-ml

Main objective of this code is to classify the fruit images as fresh or rotten using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based on their skin appearance.

We use several performance metrics to evaluate the model's performance. The metrics used are: 
1. Accuracy
2. Loss
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. F1 Score
6. Support
7. ROC Curve

The final output of this code would be a classification of the fruit images as either fresh or rotten.
